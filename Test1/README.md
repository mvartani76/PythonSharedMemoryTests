# Test 1

This test consists of two files (mem1.py and mem2.py).

mem1.py - This file creates the shared memory, writes to it and the runs a loop printing the status of the shared memory.
mem2.py - This file accesses the shared memory created in mem1.py, reads the value and prints, and then after a specified time, it changes the shared memory.

To run the test, execute a separate process for each python file.
